####  SQL Analytics-The Furniture Data Insight Project
<br>

##### The Home Furniture Pvt. Ltd. SQL project analyzes sales data with the objective of extracting actionable insight for business growth. Relational databases from raw sales data enabled a closer analysis of key performance metrics by category, brand, and store type.

##### The analysis calculates total costs, sales, revenue, and profit margins over different product categories like tables, beds, and desks while revealing differences between the stores or locations and delivery times. The project further goes to evaluate seasonal revenue trends, payment method preferences, and inventory levels by region in order to give a detailed understanding of what drives the company's sales performance. It further identifies the list of high-inventory-low-sales items and highlights which products have the highest rate of discounts. It shows seasonal trends to manage optimum levels of stock.

##### These questions are based on SQL-based queries for better distribution and improvement of inventory, optimization of product offers, as well as increased profitability in sales. Some of the key recommendations include increased selling focus on high-potential products, inventory solution, and optimizing delivery methods to increase customer satisfaction while improving sales growth.
